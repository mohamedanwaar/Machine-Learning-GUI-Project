# Machine Learning GUI Project

## Overview

This project provides an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) for performing machine learning tasks, including data preprocessing, model selection, and performance evaluation. The application is designed to facilitate the use of common machine learning algorithms with minimal coding, making it accessible for users with varying levels of expertise.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Automates the preprocessing of datasets, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.
- **Model Selection**: Allows users to choose from a variety of supervised and unsupervised machine learning models.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Provides real-time performance metrics for selected models, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Models Included

1. **Decision Tree**: A versatile model used for classification and regression tasks. The Decision Tree algorithm splits the data into subsets based on feature values to make predictions.
   
2. **K-Means Clustering**: An unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions the dataset into K clusters based on feature similarity. Useful for discovering patterns and groupings within the data.

3. **Linear Regression**: A regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful classification algorithm that finds the hyperplane that best separates data into different classes. SVMs are effective for high-dimensional spaces and various kernel functions.

## How It Works

1. **Load Data**: Import datasets in various formats (e.g., CSV, Excel) into the application.
2. **Preprocess Data**: Automatically handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
3. **Select and Train Models**: Choose from Decision Tree, K-Means, Linear Regression, and SVM models to train on the preprocessed data.
4. **Evaluate Models**: View performance metrics and visualizations to assess model performance and make informed decisions.
